This is a new launcher that combines the capabilities of fps_unlocker, 3dmigoto, and reshade into a single executable without having to launch multiple processes or worry about timing. While there are some useful tweaks to compatibility, the core functionality has always been available to those who know how and don't mind the launch process. This tool is called Open Genshin because you literally use it to open Genshin, but also because the driving ideal is openness for the mod community. More specifically this tool is intended to displace the bad actors in the scene who are actively scamming users and illegally profiting off of plagiarized or unlicensed work. Specifically one individual has maintained a tool that provides the same function as my launcher but with access to certain features paywalled in the scummiest way possible with the program actively deleting benefits (that they were not authorized to sell) when subscriptions run out which is almost unheard of for this kind of program. Their launcher also includes spyware and has many other dubious qualities, though its true nature is not obvious at first. Despite these many issues, they have somehow maintained a large user base solely due to being the only option for most people. But we can put that to rest with the release of this tool which will always remain completely free and is designed to respect author rights, especially when it comes to the redistribution of ReShade effects. Other repositories with similar patches to use ReShade include pirated ReShade effects such as the MartyMcFly rayshading effects. I am not going to actively wage a war against these people but I do hope that by providing this tool set for free I can put a stop to their unjust and unearned rewards. If you're reading this, do better as a person and a creator. Provide something new and original and then there will be no issue with you taking money.
