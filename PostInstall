Your installation is complete! The game launcher should also have opened for you so feel free to jump right into the game!
For now this will be the landing page for the repo where you can learn more about how to use everything included and find easy links to other free and paid shaders I couldn't distribute. 

More usage instructions and information available in the readme. This is still a WIP but the goal is within the next few weeks to have a fleshed out guide that addresses topics I may not have thought of
