If you have some ideas I'm open to hearing them and you can make pull requests here or on the relevant repos but for now I'm only looking for preset authors.
I may be getting ahead of myself too much in even expecting that, but I figure its best to set this up just in case
For presets you should fork the repo, upload your preset under the Presets directory and include either a message or a .md file next to the preset with the following info

Preset name if you have one

Use case (performance, quality, photography)

System Specs (just GPU/CPU is fine)

Typical framerate (can be a rough estimate) 

Link to offsite media if you have any

You can include screenshots in your own fork in a zip file, but I am currently keeping media off the github. 
For now I don't want to be too disorganized across multiple sites but I'm going to open a project page on gamebanana that can serve as a frontend hub where media is showcased
I'm not sure how contributing works on there exactly but I think I can add as collaborators any preset authors who I approve through a pull request so you can share your preset yourself
