More Shaders:

https://github.com/ipsusu/IpsuShade
https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade 
  gshade installer is included in the archive already but releases comes with a noninstaller version that I don't have perms to distribute
https://github.com/martymcmodding/iMMERSE 
  free marty's mod shaders, recommend getting these regardless of whether you get his paid suite
https://www.martysmods.com/ 
  paid access to the rest of martys mods and publicly accessible guides that are worth reading even if you don't buy
  I don't normally like to shill for paywalled stuff but these shaders are the real deal and you can keep everything from a one time sub
  I highly recommend getting these if you want raytracing and other top tier effects. You should have downloaded an RTGI implementation already but it doesnt stack up
  
Really good writeup on what every shader does and recommendations from the viewpoint of ingame photography: 
https://framedsc.com/ReshadeGuides/shaderscatalogue.htm

There is already a preset that sorts some of the useful photography shaders to the top but I intend to give more detailed guides and better presets for that purpose 
I hope that mod authors for gimi will catch onto this and take their showcases to the next level
