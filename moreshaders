More Shaders:

https://github.com/martymcmodding/iMMERSE (free marty's mod)
https://github.com/ipsusu/IpsuShade
https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade (gshade installer is included in the archive already but releases comes with a noninstaller version)
https://www.martysmods.com/ 
  paid access to the rest of martys mods and publicly accessible guides
  I don't normally like to shill for paywalled stuff but these shaders are the real deal and you can keep everything from a one time sub so 
  I highly recommend doing so if you want raytracing and other top tier effects

Really good writeup on what every shader does and recommendations from the viewpoint of ingame photography: 
https://framedsc.com/ReshadeGuides/shaderscatalogue.htm

There is already a preset that sorts some of the useful photography shaders to the top but I intend to give more detailed guides and better presets for that purpose 
I hope that mod authors for gimi will be all over this and take their showcases to the next level
