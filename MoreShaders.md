More Shaders:

[IpsuShade](https://github.com/ipsusu/IpsuShade) 
  - collection of many tweaked or custom effects
[GShade](https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade)
   - use non-installer version to grab all effects and presets
   - 
[Immerse](https://github.com/martymcmodding/iMMERSE)
  - free marty's mod shaders, included in the installer but I want to emphasize them
  - Useful in combination with other effects, critical for using his paid suite
[Marty's Mods](https://www.martysmods.com/ ) - paid access to the rest of martys mods and publicly accessible guides that are worth reading even if you don't buy
  - I don't normally like to shill for paywalled stuff but these shaders are the real deal and you can keep everything from a one time sub
  - I highly recommend getting these if you want raytracing and other top tier effects. You should have downloaded an RTGI implementation already but it doesnt stack up
  - Presets using his shaders will be included but you still need to own them yourself
  
[Really good writeup on what every shader does and recommendations from the viewpoint of ingame photography](https://framedsc.com/ReshadeGuides/shaderscatalogue.htm)

There is already a preset that sorts some of the useful photography shaders to the top but I intend to give more detailed guides and better presets for that purpose 
I hope that mod authors for gimi will catch onto this and take their showcases to the next level
